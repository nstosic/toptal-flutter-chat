# Toptal Flutter Chat

Cross-platform demo chat client developed using Flutter & Firebase for Toptal Engineering Blog article.

# Build environment

This project is developed to work with `flutter channel stable`. There is no guarantee that it will work on different flutter channels.

# API keys

Note - if you clone this repository and try running the project, it'll fail because I've removed API keys for Facebook and Firebase. Refer to the [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/) or [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup) official documentation for a step-by-step guide to setting up the project.
